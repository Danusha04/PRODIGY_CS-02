# Image Encryption Tool

A simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by modifying pixel values. The encryption method involves swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel.

## Features

- Encrypt images using a key-based pixel manipulation technique.
- Decrypt images using the same key to restore the original image.
- Easy-to-use functions for encryption and decryption.
  
# Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```
## Usage

1. Place an image file named `input_image.jpg` in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script with Python:

    ```bash
    python image_encryption.py
    ```

3. The encrypted image will be saved as `encrypted_image.jpg`, and the decrypted image will be saved as `decrypted_image.jpg`.
